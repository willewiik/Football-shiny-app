# Football-shiny-app

An R Shiny app was created to showcase statistics on football teams and players. It features models that predict various metrics, including the number of shots and corners a team might have in a specific match. The app also produces diagrams that enable the exploration of trends and patterns within the data. The data was sourced from fbref and understat, and subsequently stored in a SQL database.
